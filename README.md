This particular "cheat sheet" includes information I feel was important and omits ideas and equations I had confidence in remembering.

Adapted from this [formula sheet template](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/8827/preparing-cheat-sheets). 

## Editing

To edit this formula sheet, you will need to download `FormulaSheet.tex` and open it in your favorite LaTeX edting software (I used [TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) for this, but [OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is a nice online solution).
